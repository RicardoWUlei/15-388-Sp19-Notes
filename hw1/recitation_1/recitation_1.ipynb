    "### Homework Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* start early; you should already be mostly through `hw1_scraper`\n",
    "* once the environment is set up, `hw1_get_started` should take you ~10 minutes to finish \n",
    "* 20 minutes reading documentation will save you 8 hours of writing code\n",
    "* write your own tests! The tests we give you clarify what the code should output, not (sufficiently) show that your code is correct.\n",
    "* The last TA hours before an assignment due is always the most crowded. Don't rely on those to complete your assignment.\n",
    "* Talk to other students taking the course -- they can help you and you can help them.\n",
    "* Look for the \"Common Problems in Homework x\" post on Diderot before asking questions online.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Autograder\n",
    "\n",
    "* The autograder status is announced on Diderot: if it is down, the announcement is pinned and I provide updates every few hours.\n",
    "* Autograder changes are also announced and (briefly) pinned. I will announce changes in some detail. I will likely _not_ regrade assignments that have received full scores.\n",
    "* Currently we have no submission limit. Compute power is a finite resource and ~200 students share it; if someone abuses it we will limit the number of submissions.\n",
    "* You should be able to see the Autograder output. Use the output to guide your debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### TA Hours\n",
    "\n",
    "* Come early, come often. You learn a lot by listening to others problems and discussing your problems with them\n",
    "* We triage problems, group students, and deal with groups. For large classes, this is vastly more efficient.\n",
    "  * We will correct misunderstandings, but will not directly give you the correct answer\n",
    "  * TAs may direct you to other students with similar problems and ask you to work together until we can see you\n",
    "  * Students are _not_ seen in a first-come-first-serve queue\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Python environments take a little practice to get exactly right. It is very easy to spectacularly mess it up, as Randall Munroe illustrates on xkcd:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage you to use Vagrant because it sets up a clean, repeatable environment in a virtual machine. You may also wish to use Anaconda (a popular all-in-one solution), or Windows Subsystem for Linux (run Ubuntu/Fedora/Debian as a Windows app).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, **never run `sudo pip install ...`**. Instead, try `pip --user install ...` \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/T1fubRO.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Running `sudo pip install ...` gives random people on the internet, and me, root access to your machine. That is a Very Bad Idea."

    "## Writing Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing good tests requires you understand the problem domain and _what can go wrong_. Typically, you learn what can go wrong by making those mistakes over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "When writing your tests, there are two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- bottom-up/unit testing, where you test the smallest part of your code for correctness and gradually move up the function hierarchy. These are easy to write at low levels but get expensive as the output becomes more complex. \n",
    "- top-down/global/functional/integration testing, where you have some input (ideally real-world input) and manually verified output. These are (generally) expensive to build, though you can trade quality for time by writing synthetic tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "We give you both tests, and our grader runs both types of tests on your code, but we generally weigh top-down tests much more. If you cannot pass a test, it is likely that there is an [unknown unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window) factor at play and you should try your code on more tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you don't write a single test so much as a suite of tests. Instead of just writing many large tests, begin by writing the smallest possible test to check a feature then copy it and add complexity to it. If you discover a bug, the tests that pass give you valuable information on what must be causing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Write _regression_ tests. When you discover a bug\n",
    "\n",
    "1. write a test that should fail\n",
    "2. check that the test does fail\n",
    "3. fix the bug\n",
    "4. check that the test now passes\n",
    "\n",
    "This way you will catch similar bugs in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "For `hw1_xml_parser`, we have a thread where you can share your tests; regression tests are especially valuable because if you made a mistake it is likely that others will as well."
